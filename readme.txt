Guest management system.

There are times we need to record and keep track of guests that enters into your organization, and this project helps to automate that process.

This is how the workflow is: 
A guest enters in your organization
First meeting is with the front desk officer or receptionist.
Normally, the front desk officer would tell the guest that it is required the fill in their personal details in the a form
Once the guest does all of that, he or she would be allowed to enter into the main office premises
But all these can be automated, to save you less stress and that is the focus of this project

It comes with a user auth system, to control user authentication and permission
it also comes with a guest app, that keeps tracks of guests that enters the office premises.
